## üõ†Ô∏è **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ADHD-Management-Workflow.git
cd ADHD-Management-Workflow
```

### **2. Create `firebase.js` File**
Since **Firebase credentials** are sensitive, the `firebase.js` file is **excluded** from the repository for security. Follow these steps to create it:

1. **Go to Firebase Console** ‚Üí Create a project.  
2. Enable **Authentication** (Email/Password) and set up **Firestore Database**.  
3. Copy your Firebase configuration from the project settings.

**Create `firebase.js`** inside the root folder:
```javascript
import { initializeApp } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.16.0/firebase-app.js';
import { getAuth } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.16.0/firebase-auth.js';
import { getFirestore } from 'https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.16.0/firebase-firestore.js';

const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const auth = getAuth(app);
const db = getFirestore(app);

export { auth, db };
```
Replace all the placeholder values (`YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN`, etc.) with your Firebase project settings.
